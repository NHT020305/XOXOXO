## How to play

**Objective**: The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to align three of their symbols—either X or O—in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid.

**Turn-taking**: Players place their symbol (X for the first player and O for the second player) on an empty grid cell.

**Grid Constraints**: Each cell on the 3x3 grid can only hold one symbol at a time, and once placed, a symbol cannot be moved to another cell.

**Winning Conditions**: A player wins the game immediately if they successfully line up three symbols in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Draw Condition**: If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

**Player Strategy**: Players must strategize to block their opponent's attempts to create a winning line while simultaneously planning their winning moves.
