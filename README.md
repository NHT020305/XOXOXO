## How to play
# Objective: 
The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to align three of their symbols—either X or O—in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid.

# Turn-taking: 
Players take turns placing their symbol (X for the first player and O for the second player) on an empty cell of the grid.

# Grid Constraints: 
Each cell on the 3x3 grid can only hold one symbol at a time, and once placed, a symbol cannot be moved to another cell.

# Winning Conditions: 
A player wins the game immediately if they successfully line up three of their symbols in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Draw Condition: 
If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
