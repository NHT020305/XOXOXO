          <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Objective:</span> The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first
              player to align three of their symbols—either X or O—in a
              horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Turn-taking:</span> Players take turns placing their symbol
              (X for the first player and O for the second player) on an empty
              cell of the grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Grid Constraints:</span> Each cell on the 3x3 grid can only
              hold one symbol at a time, and once placed, a symbol cannot be
              moved to another cell.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Winning Conditions:</span> A player wins the game
              immediately if they successfully line up three of their symbols in
              a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Draw Condition:</span> If all 9 cells are filled and neither
              player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a
              draw.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Player Strategy:</span> Players must strategize to block
              their opponent's attempts to create a winning line while
              simultaneously planning their own winning moves.
